# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to SC2006 SCS4, Team ByteMe Project. 

# Project Introduction

ByteMe! is a mobile application optimised for android to help Singaporeans gauge the crowd levels of hawker centres and provide hawker stall information in a single-tap! This app seeks to solve the poor user experience associated with queing for food/squeezing with the crowd by predicting crowd levels using LTA carpark availability API and redirect users to other hawker centres near them. By viewing the hawker stall information, users can also judge the quality of the food/service through reviews & reports left by other users within our app.
